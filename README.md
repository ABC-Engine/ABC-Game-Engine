## Rendering an object
``` rust
use crate::*

//First make a struct for your object

struct Ball {
    transform: Transform,
    sprite: Sprite,
}

//Every object needs the Object trait implemented

impl Object for Ball {
    fn get_sprite(&self) -> &Sprite {
        &self.sprite
    }

    fn get_transform(&self) -> &Transform {
        &self.transform
    }
}

//Every object also needs the update function (this will be called every frame)
//For this example, we aren't going to use it so we will keep it empty

impl Update for Ball {
    fn update(&mut self) {}
}

fn main()
{
    //Instantiating the object
    //first, let's make the sprite for our object
    
    let circle_sprite = Circle {
            radius: 5.0,
            color: Color {
                r: 255,
                g: 0,
                b: 0,
                a: 1.0,
            },
        };
    //now we instantiate the struct we made for our object
    
    let circle_object = Ball {
        transform: Transform {
            x: 10.0,
            y: 20.0,
            rotation: 0.0,
            scale: 1.0,
        },
        sprite: circle_sprite.into(),
    };
    
    //Let's make a scene to put our object into
    
    let mut main_scene = Scene::new();
    
    //And a renderer to render it in
    
    let mut renderer = Renderer::new(80, 40);
    
    //now we can add the object to our scene
    //Note: The order in which they are added is the order they will be rendered in
    
    main_scene.add_object(circle_object);
    
    //Finally, we can now render to our heart's content 
    //Note: every time render is called update is also called
    
    renderer.render(&mut main_scene);
}
```
