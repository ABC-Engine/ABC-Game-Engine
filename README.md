# Under Construction ðŸš§
This project is still under construction and is in the pre-release stage. Significant changes will be made that might break things. We apologize for the inconvenience.
# Console-Renderer
A unique renderer that displays through ASCII characters in the terminal
## OS Support
Right now only Windows is supported, if you are interested in adding support for other operating systems, make an issue.
# Getting Started
Note: This is subject to change, these docs could be outdated. Just bug me and I will update them for you.
## Rendering an object
``` rust
// this highlights some major issues with the current renderer
use ABC_Game_Engine::*;

// implement a system
struct SpinSystem {}

impl System for SpinSystem {
    fn run(&mut self, entities_and_components: &mut EntitiesAndComponents) {
        for entity in entities_and_components.get_entities_with_component::<Transform>().cloned().collect::<Vec<Entity>>()
        {
            entities_and_components.get_components::<(Transform,)>(entity).rotation += 1.0
        }
    }
}

// Note: this does not work in vscode terminal, but it does work in the windows terminal
fn main() {
    let mut renderer = Renderer::new(320, 160);
    // stretch is in case you can't change the line height of your terminal
    renderer.set_stretch(1.0);
    // make a scene to store our systems and objects
    let mut scene = Scene::new();
    // add the system
    scene.game_engine.add_system(Box::new(SpinSystem {}));
    {
        // how we interact with the entities and components
        // needs to be separate from the scene to avoid borrowing issues
        let mut entities_and_components = &mut scene.game_engine.entities_and_components;

        scene.scene_params.set_background_color(Color {
            r: 100,
            g: 0,
            b: 0,
            a: 0.0,
        });

        scene.scene_params.set_random_chars(true);

        let sprite = Image {
            texture: load_texture("Sample_Images/sprite.png"),
        };

        let sprite_object = entities_and_components.add_entity_with(
            Sprite::Image(sprite),
            Transform {
                x: 20.0,
                y: 20.0,
                rotation: 0.0,
                scale: 2.0,
                origin_x: 0.0,
                origin_y: 0.0,
            },
        );
    }

    loop {
        //Run all the systems
        scene.game_engine.run();

        // render the scene
        renderer.render(
            &mut scene.game_engine.entities_and_components,
            &scene.scene_params,
        );
    }
}

# Current Features
### Console Renderer
The engine comes with a fully functional renderer for the console. The renderer supports:
* Sprites
* Animations
* Basic Per Pixel Diffing
  
### Physics Engine
A basic physics engine with rigid bodies and colliders.

# Planned Features
These are the planned features for the engine in order
### Secondary non-console renderer
A non-console renderer, that can render everything without any adjustment needed other than changing the renderer.
