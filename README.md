# Under Construction ðŸš§
This project is still under construction and is in the pre-release stage. Significant changes will be made that might break things. We apologize for the inconvenience.

# Ease of use
The idea for this project is that it would be so intuitive to use that it would be feasible to learn rust through this game engine. Learning is often made better when you can make something interactable rather than *just* manipulating data and we want to provide that opportunity in Rust.

## OS Support
Most major operating systems *should* be supported, however only Windows has been tested.

# Current Features
For a complete list of features that are planned or done visit [here](https://www.figma.com/design/RGxexDMjVnLHFsUxnKaHhu/ABC-Engine-Roadmap?node-id=0-1&t=mPowocl1rquKjVa9-1)

## Renderers
Both a [console renderer](https://github.com/ABC-Engine/console_renderer) and a [pixel art renderer](https://github.com/ABC-Engine/lumenpyx).

## Physics Engine
Rapier is used for physics and can be accessed for collision info as a resource.
